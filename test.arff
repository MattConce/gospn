% Example dataset sampling a modified rain/slippery road scenario as seen on Adnan Darwiche's
% Modeling and Reasoning with Bayesian Networks (Section 4.3).
% We modified variable Winter, changing it to Season and made it into a numeric (yet
% categorical) variable just to showcase how we deal with numeric variables.
@RELATION weather
% GoSPN doesn't (yet) support continuous variables. It does accept discrete values sent as
% numeric type. In this case we assume a variable season that is discrete and has 4 possible
% values: 0, 1, 2, 3 with 0-3 being numeric representations for spring-winter.
@ATTRIBUTE season NUMERIC
% We can also use the numeric type as boolean.
@ATTRIBUTE sprinkler numeric
% Or just use class. In the case class is used, ParseArff returns the labels describing the
% valuations in the instances.
@ATTRIBUTE rain {true,false}
% We can also use string. Just like class, labels are returned separately.
@ATTRIBUTE wet_grass string
@ATTRIBUTE slippery STRING
